# Welcome to *Etterwiki*!
Ettercap is called a swiss knife for man-in-the-middle attacks.
It provides lots of features which go beyond the common knowledge of many people knowing about **ettercap**.

This wiki is intended to provide some tips and tricks that might not be so obvious but may be useful to know. That starts providing a [[guideline|git-config]] for (new) contributors, who are not used to *git* and *Github*.

Another topic is the cross-platform support. Of course, **ettercap** is natively built for Linux operating systems, however some support is also available for MacOSX. You can find more information related to MacOSX support on the [[dedicated Wiki page|macosx]].
